**Project Overview**
This project predicts **NBA playoff outcomes** using **Linear Regression** based on team performance metrics. 
The model analyzes historical data to forecast the factors impact the game.  

🔍 **Dataset**  
The dataset contains NBA team statistics, including:  
- **rank**
- **player**
- **position**	
- **total_games**
- **active_player**	

🛠 **Technologies Used**  
**Python** libraries used:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn 
**Scikit-learn** functions like LinearRegression, train_test_split, metrics are used.  

#### 🚀 **Implementation Steps**  
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values and feature selection.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing key trends and correlations.  
3. **Model Training**: Splitting data into train-test sets and training the Linear Regression model.  
4. **Model Evaluation**: Measuring performance using **R² Score** 

#### 📊 **Results & Insights**  
- The model provides insights into which factors most influence playoff success.  
- Teams with higher **field_goals, free_shots, three_points_goals** tend to reach the playoffs. 🚀
